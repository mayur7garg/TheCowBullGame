# TheCowBullGame
*__A word guessing interactive Python based game written using the pygame module.__*

### How It Works-
1. The program chooses a _4-letter word_ and _your task is to guess it._
2. The key to remember is that _the word is meaningful_ and _all the 4 letters are distinct._
3. Enter an input and the program compares your input with the chosen word and gives you hints to narrow down your search.
4. __If the word you guessed has letter(s) common with the chosen word and its(theirs) position is identical, the program raises a flag - _Bull_. If their are letters common but with different positions, the program raises a flag - _Cow_.__
_Your goal is to get __4 Bulls__ i.e. guess the entire word accurately within __10 turns__._
